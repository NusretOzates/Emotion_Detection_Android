# Emotion Detection Android App

This app is created as a POC for my deep learning class in 2020. You can directly run the project on your mobile phone.
But it will not work on the emulators because it uses the GPU by default. Most of the code is taken from a google tutorial and I only add
my model to the project and add some code to 

- show the results
- Detect and crop the only face part to get better results

As in the end of 2021, I believe these codes can be simplified by the updated libraries. Feel free to update the code!
